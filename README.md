# Highlands Team Demo
This app can only be reproduced locally because it uses OpenCV's VideoCapture function. There is no deployed version because of incompatibilities with AI camp servers and existing real-time communications protocols.

## Setup: 
    virtualenv venv
    source activate venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements
